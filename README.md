# tetera
Tetera is a software rendering engine written entirely in JavaScript without any external dependencies. It is a direct successor to the [teapot project](https://github.com/PixelTomato/teapot). Tetera aims to provided a more complete set of features, better performance, and a higher degree of usability to aid in creating more complex scenes. It is designed primarily for personal projects, and as such, any large-scale applications are probably unadvisable.

### Test Scene
Despite the hightened goals of this project compared to the teapot, it may still be non-functional at any given time. If you would like to view the demo scene regardless, it can be found here: https://pixeltomato.github.io/tetera/.
